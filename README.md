## My process

Challanged myself to build within an hour and no more. Time elapsed before I could make the mobile side 100%. Oh well...

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### Continued development

Slight bug where it breaks at around 400px which is a shame. Perhaps I really should adopt a mobile first workflow.
